# 3D Plane Game

A 3D game where you control a plane to shoot down UFOs hovering over a city.

## Requirements

- 3D environment with a city landscape
- Player-controlled airplane with movement in all directions
- Enemy UFOs with basic AI behavior
- Shooting mechanics with collision detection
- Explosions and visual effects
- Game states (start, play, victory, defeat)
- Sound effects and background music
- Score tracking

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and scene management
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling
- **Howler.js**: For audio management
- **Webpack**: For bundling and development
